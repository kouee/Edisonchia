        <h2>Sabah Flood Detection System</h2>
        <p>
            The Sabah Flood Detection System is a reliable, real-time flood monitoring solution designed to safeguard homes and communities from flood risks. Our system uses advanced water level sensors (XKC-Y23) to detect rising water levels, alerting users with visual indicators and alarms when critical flood levels are reached.
        </p>

        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>
            Floods are a significant threat to homes and communities, especially in areas prone to heavy rainfall or inadequate drainage systems. Without early detection and warning, floods can cause extensive damage to properties, disrupt lives, and pose serious risks to human safety. Existing flood monitoring solutions are often expensive or complicated to install, making it difficult for households and smaller communities to afford effective protection.
        </p>

        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>
            The primary objective of the Sabah Flood Detection System is to offer an affordable, reliable, and easy-to-deploy solution for flood monitoring. This system aims to reduce flood-related risks by providing early warnings, allowing users to take preventive action before a flood reaches critical levels.
        </p>

        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>
            Our system features three water sensors placed at different levels to detect the water rise. Each sensor triggers a corresponding LED: green for low, yellow for medium, and red for high flood levels. When all sensors detect water, the system notifies the user that a dangerous flood level has been reached, allowing for early intervention.
        </p>
